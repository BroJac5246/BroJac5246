ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m [@BroJac5246](https://github.com/BroJac5246/)!

ðŸ‘€ I love coding. I'm low-to-moderately familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, plus I know basic Java and Kotlin.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently ~~learning Kotlin!~~ ~~_attempting to learn Kotlin but fighting with Android Studio_~~ **learning Kotlin for real this time!**

  I'm also learning Java

ðŸ“« You can always reach me on Scratch, I'm [@jbthepig](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/jbthepig)

ðŸŽ¨ I'm a big fan of Material You! I know it's controversial, but I love the large corner radii :D
